Ideas for future extension
==========================

- optional fraction arg after value arg
	- a/b + c/d = (ad + cb)/bd
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm

- plugin architecture using `lthooks` (WIP in local stash)

- attempt to calculate missing factors by traversing segment units?
	1/3 rigsdaler = 24 skilling = 1 ort = 1.5 mark
		6/4 => 3/2

- use thousands-separators (from siunitx?) in display macros

- column type with collcell for automatic parsing of table cells?
	needs some logic for headers (placeholder like \nduSym?)

- more units
