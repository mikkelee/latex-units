Ideas for future extension
==========================

- optional fraction arg after value arg
	- https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/180853/

- plugin architecture using `lthooks` (WIP in local stash)

- option to hide zeros when showing sums

- subtraction, division, multiplication (us repr as intermediate value)

- maybe change unit setup to eg. `\nduNewUnit{danish rigsdaler}{rigsdaler.mark.skilling}` and populate based on something similar to common units. this would also allow easier interop with intermediate units
	- 1 hvid = ½ mark = 3 skilling
	- 1 ort = ¼ rigsdaler = 24 skilling

- more units:
	- danish:
		- lispund/pund
